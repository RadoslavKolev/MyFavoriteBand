        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
            Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer
            Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive 
            musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current
            lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist 
            Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney,
            Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.

            Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, Master of Puppets (1986), often cited as one of the heaviest
            and most influential thrash metal albums. The band's next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award 
            nomination. Its eponymous fifth album, Metallica (1991), the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal, appealed to a more 
            mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it 
            the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica 
            returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the 
            band's earlier albums. The band's most recent album is Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, released in 2016.

            In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed 
            lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica 
            was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which documented the troubled production of the 
            band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the 
            Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band wrote the screenplay for and starred in the 2013 IMAX concert film Metallica: Through the Never, 
            in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.

            Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, twelve video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music 
            videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with Metallica) have 
            consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, 
            having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by 
            magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked them at no. 61 on its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list. As of 2017, Metallica is the 
            third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million albums in the 
            United States.
